municipalContent=The Municipal division has a very specific customer base and adds support to the Waterworks/Underground division. The Municipal division specifically deals with Government-owned entities. We focus on the sale of water metering systems and brass water service fittings.Etna Supply provides Municipalities with pipe and drains, meters and even fire hydrants. Our Sales and Customer Service staff are trained to help Cities and Municipalities provide the underlying infrastructure required to support neighborhoods and commercial parks. The meter systems the Municipal division sells have several components. The meter itself, depending on the use, can be 5/8" for a residential home to over 16" to be used in a factory or pump station. Another component of the system is the ability to read the meter visually, electronically or remotely with a computer program by simply driving down the street.The Municipal division has also been using e-commerce with its customers for a number of years. This permits the Municipality to see in-stock products, the price, and ordering online.Marketing Philosophy - An expert provider of quality products with strong customer relationships based on knowledge, education, and trust.
